We have Jenkins, Github Actions for CI/CD

Why Jenkisn, Why Github Actions

If the project is Public, then the github actions is the winner as the Github Hosted Runners are absolutely free
If the project is Private, then the Jenkins is better than actions, as we have better plugins and support

We aslo have selfhosted runners in github actions for private projects, but the jenkins is far better
